This is an example repository of how to implement typesafe forms using [react-ts-form](https://react-ts-form.com/) and [zact](https://github.com/pingdotgg/zact) to have typesafety on the frontend and backend. In my opinion, this is the evolution that comes after [trpc](https://trpc.io/).

See the video about it [here](https://youtu.be/NHF9JJDafkg).

One thing I couldn't figure out: usint TailwindCSS with `react-ts-form`. If you have a solution for getting TailwindCSS to work in the form components, please open a PR. I'd love to see that.
