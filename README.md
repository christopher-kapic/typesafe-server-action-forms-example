This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an example repository of how to implement typesafe forms using [react-ts-form](https://react-ts-form.com/) and [zact](https://github.com/pingdotgg/zact) to have typesafty on the frontend and backend. In my opinion, this is the evolution that comes after [trpc](https://trpc.io/).

See the video about it [here](https://youtu.be/NHF9JJDafkg).
